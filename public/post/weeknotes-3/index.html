At work I added a bunch of functionality to our internal admin panel. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely bit of software, a server rendered website written with Node &amp;amp; Express, no build step, no fat client side frameworks, and for the most part works without JS at all. ">

  <p>It&rsquo;s been a pretty unremarkable week again. I started writing weeknotes in order to remember <em>more</em> about what I&rsquo;m doing with my life. I should probably start writing them incrementally over the course of a week, rather than getting to the end and being completely blank.</p>

<p>Anyway. This week, from what I remember:</p>

<p>At work I added a bunch of functionality to our internal admin panel. It&rsquo;s a lovely bit of software, a server rendered website written with Node &amp; Express, no build step, no fat client side frameworks, and for the most part works without JS at all. Simpler times. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about ✨ tools ✨ recently. There&rsquo;s probably a separate blog post coming at some point in the indeterminate future.</p>

<p>On Monday, we had an urgent front-end deployment to roll out, but our CI pipeline was, to put it bluntly, fucked. Much to my amusement, and after much deliberation, we decided to embark on a pretty dodgy exercise of manually copying our static build files to s3. The modern equivalent of drag-and-dropping files on to an FTP server. Full circle?</p>

<p>Spent time with Leah, friends, family at the weekend which was great. This weekend I&rsquo;m planning on <em>doing things</em> but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what yet. Time will tell.</p>
