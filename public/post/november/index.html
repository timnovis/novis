<p>With a lot of deliberation, I left my previous job after being offered the opportunity to help build a <a href="https://www.daisie.com/">new early stage startup</a> from the ground up - I&rsquo;m really excited about the new job, there&rsquo;s a lot to get my teeth stuck into from product design all the way through to actually building the application, 2018&rsquo;s shaping up to be a pretty interesting year. It also has to be said that I&rsquo;m really enjoying working as part of what&rsquo;s mainly a two-person team, definitely a welcome change.</p>
