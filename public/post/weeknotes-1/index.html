  <p>I&rsquo;ve been back from Japan for a few days now, the jetlag is finally wearing off after a weekend of feeling horribly confused. Not that I&rsquo;m complaining.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great to see my coworkers and friends again, catching up on all that I&rsquo;ve missed over the past 2 weeks. I feel like I&rsquo;m getting back into the flow.</p>

<p>So far this week at work, I&rsquo;ve tied up a few loose ends on the API to do with user locations, fixed a couple of minor outstanding bugs from the backlog and am about to start on a larger piece of work related to notifications &amp; activity, which <em>sounds</em> very vague.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started working on a new ✨side project ✨ with my esteemed friend and ex-colleague <a href="https://joshmcmillan.com/">Josh</a>, called <a href="https://rhythm.cool/">Rhythm</a>, to help people write weeknotes and roll them up into some kind of publication.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>
