    <p>I needed a place to store my thoughts and record any work I&rsquo;ve been doing, and my personal website was in dire need of a refresh.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kept it simple - at the time of writing, this website comes in to the browser at under 20kb. No client-side JavaScript, and the CSS is very minimal. You can find the code (and posts) for this website <a href="https://github.com/timnovis/novis">here</a>.</p>

<p>I was originally going to use a static site generator - whilst it would have been fun to learn about them, I didn&rsquo;t want to conform to their way of doing things. This website is very simple; it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://hapijs.com/">Hapi.js</a> server which reads a directory of markdown files and turns them into static routes. Nothing more, nothing less. It only took me a couple of hours this evening to get going, and I&rsquo;m really happy with the result.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a while since I&rsquo;ve coded a front-end project this basic, there are no build tools involved, just HTML and CSS. It was a refreshing experience.</p>

<p>This website will serve as a catalog for things I find interesting, thoughts about articles I&rsquo;ve read, maybe even the occasional photo.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be back soon with more. - Tim</p>
