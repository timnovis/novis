<p>I started writing weeknotes with every intention of doing them with some punctuality, but I think I should probably rename them to &ldquo;when I feel like it&rdquo; notes.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a reasonably hectic couple of months. We (re)launched our public product at Daisie, so we&rsquo;ve had all hands on deck getting that live, making optimisations and responding to user feedback which has been invaluable. That being said, I&rsquo;m certainly starting to feel the effects of burnout take a toll on me.</p>

<h2 id="some-personal-news">Some âœ¨ personal news âœ¨</h2>

<p>About a month ago, I handed in my notice at Daisie as I&rsquo;ve taken a new role as a Software Engineer at the Financial Times on the consumer products team. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the move, I&rsquo;m excited to learn from and work with the incredibly talented team they&rsquo;ve built there, everyone I met and interacted with during the interview process were nothing short of wonderful.</p>

<p>I have really mixed feelings about leaving Daisie, whilst I&rsquo;ve no doubt developed as an engineer and learnt a hell of a lot about how startups function over the past ~2 years, the change in the work I&rsquo;ll be doing and the change in culture is going to be welcome.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a week off between leaving Daisie (today) and starting my new role, time for some well needed rest.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now ðŸ‘‹</p>
