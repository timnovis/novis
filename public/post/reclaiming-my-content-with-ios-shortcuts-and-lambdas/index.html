<p>Today I built a thing to allow me to get photos from my phone to this website without much manual intervention. I&rsquo;ve dubbed it Timstagram.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.novis.co/photos/">Check out Timstagram</a></p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

<p>There are photos on my iPhone I don&rsquo;t really want to upload to Instagram.</p>

<h4 id="part-1-ios-shortcut">Part 1 - iOS Shortcut</h4>

<p>I created an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios">iOS Shortcut</a> to take a photo from my camera roll, and send it through some wires and oceans finally reaching my website.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t really explored Shortcuts too much since their release but I&rsquo;m suitably impressed and already I&rsquo;m thinking of all the things I can do with them going forward. The shortcut is too large to screenshot in its entirety, but it does a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>âœ… Prompts me for a photo from my camera roll</li>
<li>âœ… Does a bunch of transformations on it, eventually ending up as base64</li>
<li>âœ… Asks me for a caption</li>
<li>âœ… Beams that juicy info up to my remote function</li>
<li>âœ… Shows a local success or failure notification</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Not the whole configuration, but the good bits:</em></p>

<p><img style="max-width: 45%" src="/media/misc/shortcut-1.PNG" alt="iOS Shortcut Configuration 1">
<img style="max-width: 45%" src="/media/misc/shortcut-3.jpg" alt="iOS Shortcut Configuration 2"></p>

<h4 id="part-2-netlify-function">Part 2 - Netlify Function</h4>

<p>At this point in time, this website is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> - meaning it&rsquo;s basically a bunch of static HTML files. It&rsquo;s also hosted on Netlify, meaning I&rsquo;m able to take advantage of Netlify Functions.</p>

<p>I built an endpoint (a lambda if we&rsquo;re being fancy) to process the information from the shortcut, and commit a blog post to my blog posts repo using GitHub&rsquo;s API.</p>

<p>What this means is: each time I want to upload a photo to this website, I essentially have to make a code change and add the image as a blob to the repo, and re-deploy the website on Netlify for it to appear.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/timnovis/novis/blob/master/functions/src/timstagram.js">Check out the code for the function here</a></p>

<h4 id="part-3-the-future">Part 3 - The Future?</h4>

<p>I really like the idea of reclaiming ownership over my content, and I&rsquo;m hoping to push forward with it and start using this website as a place to keep things as well as on the large centralised social networks. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll start looking at integrating some IndieWeb stuff here at some point too.</p>
