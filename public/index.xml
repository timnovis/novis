      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to some fantastic albums this month, some of which I haven&amp;rsquo;t listened to in a long while. A pleasant mix of odd, creepy folk music, strange Swedish electro &amp;amp; smooth jazzy tones.
Music  Timber Timbre - Timber Timbre Thievery Corporation - Radio Retaliation The Dining Rooms - Numero Deux Deerhunter - Halcyon Digest The Knife - Silent Shout  I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered The Guardian&amp;rsquo;s Audio Long Reads podcasts, they&amp;rsquo;re a great length and the content is often reallly interesting.</description>

      <description>I needed a place to store my thoughts and record any work I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, and my personal website was in dire need of a refresh.
I&amp;rsquo;ve kept it simple - at the time of writing, this website comes in to the browser at under 20kb. No client-side JavaScript, and the CSS is very minimal. You can find the code (and posts) for this website here.
I was originally going to use a static site generator - whilst it would have been fun to learn about them, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to conform to their way of doing things.</description>
