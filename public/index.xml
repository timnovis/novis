      <description>I started writing weeknotes with every intention of doing them with some punctuality, but I think I should probably rename them to &amp;ldquo;when I feel like it&amp;rdquo; notes.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a reasonably hectic couple of months. We (re)launched our public product at Daisie, so we&amp;rsquo;ve had all hands on deck getting that live, making optimisations and responding to user feedback which has been invaluable. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m certainly starting to feel the effects of burnout take a toll on me.</description>

      <description>A slightly belated and extremely sparse weeknotes, sorry fans. The weather has been absolutely glorious this bank holiday weekend so I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending most of my time out and about, seeing friends and family, as well as attending my first Seder on Friday with Leah&amp;rsquo;s family which was great. As far as work goes, it&amp;rsquo;s been extremely regular. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some fairly cool challenges. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much else to add.</description>

      <description>I mentioned in my weeknotes that I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling rather conflicted recently regarding the state of modern front-end tooling, and common practices that seem to have become the status quo. Before I get into it, I&amp;rsquo;ll preface by saying this: I&amp;rsquo;m not anti-JS (I am primarily a JavaScript developer), and I&amp;rsquo;m not anti-web. You could say I&amp;rsquo;m that a bit of a centrist when it comes to this debate. I love React, Vue, TypeScript and all of the goodness that the last few years of web innovation has produced, but (imo) there&amp;rsquo;s a large subset of developers who suffer from an extreme case of tunnel vision when it comes to discussing what it means to build for the web platform.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty unremarkable week again. I started writing weeknotes in order to remember more about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with my life. I should probably start writing them incrementally over the course of a week, rather than getting to the end and being completely blank.
Anyway. This week, from what I remember:
At work I added a bunch of functionality to our internal admin panel. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely bit of software, a server rendered website written with Node &amp;amp; Express, no build step, no fat client side frameworks, and for the most part works without JS at all.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been back from Japan for a few days now, the jetlag is finally wearing off after a weekend of feeling horribly confused. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m complaining.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see my coworkers and friends again, catching up on all that I&amp;rsquo;ve missed over the past 2 weeks. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into the flow.
So far this week at work, I&amp;rsquo;ve tied up a few loose ends on the API to do with user locations, fixed a couple of minor outstanding bugs from the backlog and am about to start on a larger piece of work related to notifications &amp;amp; activity, which sounds very vague.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on holiday in Japan for ~2 weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s the longest break I&amp;rsquo;ve taken in quite a while, and I&amp;rsquo;m having a great time. I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly had a chance to reflect on the past two years of my life and career. It&amp;rsquo;s been great to take a step back and think.
I brought my laptop with me &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;ve opened it twice in the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been here which has been, quite honestly, liberating.</description>

      <title>Building to AppCenter from GitLab</title>

      <description>When I initially found out about AppCenter.ms, I was really excited to start using it, until, to my disappointment, I found that there was no support for GitLab. I didn&amp;rsquo;t stop there though!
I knew in order to get this working I&amp;rsquo;d have to use one of AppCenter&amp;rsquo;s supported git integrations, GitHub, BitBucket or VSTS. I knew I could mirror the repository from GitLab to one of these providers, and the most cost effective option seemed to be BitBucket as they have a great free plan for teams which allows private repositories.</description>

      <description>Is there anything more infuriating than diving into a JavaScript project to find this?
import Component from &amp;#39;../../../some/deeply/ambiguous/location&amp;#39;;  Imagine if we could just import Component from &#39;myAlias/component&#39;; from anywhere in the codebase!
It&amp;rsquo;s super easy to set up - and there are a few ways to achieve it too.
1. With .babelrc If your project doesn&amp;rsquo;t use Webpack - for example if you&amp;rsquo;re working with React Native, you can use your .</description>
