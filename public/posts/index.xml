      <description>Today I built a thing to allow me to get photos from my phone to this website without much manual intervention. I&amp;rsquo;ve dubbed it Timstagram.
Check out Timstagram
Why? There are photos on my iPhone I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to upload to Instagram.
Part 1 - iOS Shortcut I created an iOS Shortcut to take a photo from my camera roll, and send it through some wires and oceans finally reaching my website.</description>

      <description>Yet again, it&amp;rsquo;s been a rather long time since I last wrote anything here. That being said, I did update my website – and if you&amp;rsquo;re surfing using a device with a pointer (likely a computer) then you&amp;rsquo;ll notice a wonderful new emoji cursor trail. If it&amp;rsquo;s too distracting or otherwise unpleasant for you, there&amp;rsquo;s an option to turn this off at the bottom of the website. I used JavaScript modules natively in the browser using &amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;module&amp;quot;&amp;gt; for the little JS that this website requires, and wow do I love the future.</description>

      <description>I started writing weeknotes with every intention of doing them with some punctuality, but I think I should probably rename them to &amp;ldquo;when I feel like it&amp;rdquo; notes.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a reasonably hectic couple of months. We (re)launched our public product at Daisie, so we&amp;rsquo;ve had all hands on deck getting that live, making optimisations and responding to user feedback which has been invaluable. That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m certainly starting to feel the effects of burnout take a toll on me.</description>

      <description>A slightly belated and extremely sparse weeknotes, sorry fans. The weather has been absolutely glorious this bank holiday weekend so I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending most of my time out and about, seeing friends and family, as well as attending my first Seder on Friday with Leah&amp;rsquo;s family which was great. As far as work goes, it&amp;rsquo;s been extremely regular. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some fairly cool challenges. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much else to add.</description>

      <description>I mentioned in my weeknotes that I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling rather conflicted recently regarding the state of modern front-end tooling, and common practices that seem to have become the status quo. Before I get into it, I&amp;rsquo;ll preface by saying this: I&amp;rsquo;m not anti-JS (I am primarily a JavaScript developer), and I&amp;rsquo;m not anti-web. You could say I&amp;rsquo;m that a bit of a centrist when it comes to this debate. I love React, Vue, TypeScript and all of the goodness that the last few years of web innovation has produced, but (imo) there&amp;rsquo;s a large subset of developers who suffer from an extreme case of tunnel vision when it comes to discussing what it means to build for the web platform.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty unremarkable week again. I started writing weeknotes in order to remember more about what I&amp;rsquo;m doing with my life. I should probably start writing them incrementally over the course of a week, rather than getting to the end and being completely blank.
Anyway. This week, from what I remember:
At work I added a bunch of functionality to our internal admin panel. It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely bit of software, a server rendered website written with Node &amp;amp; Express, no build step, no fat client side frameworks, and for the most part works without JS at all.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been back from Japan for a few days now, the jetlag is finally wearing off after a weekend of feeling horribly confused. Not that I&amp;rsquo;m complaining.
It&amp;rsquo;s great to see my coworkers and friends again, catching up on all that I&amp;rsquo;ve missed over the past 2 weeks. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m getting back into the flow.
So far this week at work, I&amp;rsquo;ve tied up a few loose ends on the API to do with user locations, fixed a couple of minor outstanding bugs from the backlog and am about to start on a larger piece of work related to notifications &amp;amp; activity, which sounds very vague.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on holiday in Japan for ~2 weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s the longest break I&amp;rsquo;ve taken in quite a while, and I&amp;rsquo;m having a great time. I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly had a chance to reflect on the past two years of my life and career. It&amp;rsquo;s been great to take a step back and think.
I brought my laptop with me &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;ve opened it twice in the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been here which has been, quite honestly, liberating.</description>
