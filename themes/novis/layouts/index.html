      <h1>Tim Novis
        <span>is a software engineer</span></h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website, I'm glad you're here. I'm a software engineer based in London, UK.</p>

    <article>
      <p>I help companies to build products mainly using web technologies, supported by tools such as TypeScript,
        Node.js, React and React Native.</p>

      <p>I'm equally as comfortable without these tools as I am with them, and I'm happy to pick up whatever technology
        is best suited to the job, having worked with lots of different stacks over the years.</p>

      <p>Right now I'm working as a software engineer for the Financial Times, where I help out with shipping features
        for
        <a href="https://www.ft.com/">FT.com</a>. I'm also advising
        <a href="https://contact.agency/">Contact</a>, helping out with the planning and build of their upcoming iOS
        app.
      </p>

      <p>If you wanna say hi, you can find me
