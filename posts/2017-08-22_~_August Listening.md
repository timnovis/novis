I've been listening to some fantastic albums this month, some of which I haven't listened to in a long while. A pleasant mix of odd, creepy folk music, strange Swedish electro & smooth jazzy tones.

I've recently discovered The Guardian's [Audio Long Reads](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/the-audio-long-read) podcasts, they're a great length and the content is often reallly interesting. Out of the few I've listened to this month, I especially enjoyed [God in the machine: my strange journey into transhumanism](https://overcast.fm/+G2W0_J8nY), well worth a listen if you're interested in the intersection between computing, philosophy and artificial intelligence.
