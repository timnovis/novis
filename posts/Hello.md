Welcome, I've been thinking.

I needed a place to store my thoughts and record any interesting work I've been doing, and my personal website was in dire need of a refresh.

I've kept it simple - at the time of writing, this website comes in to the browser at under 20kb. No client-side JavaScript, and the CSS is very minimal. You can find the code (and posts) for this website [here](https://github.com/timnovis/novis).

I was originally going to use a static site generator - whilst it would have been fun to learn about them, I didn't want to conform to their way of doing things. This website is very simple; it's a [Hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) server which reads a directory of markdown files and turns them into static routes. Nothing more, nothing less. It only took me a couple of hours this evening to get going, and I'm really happy with the result.

It's been quite a while since I've embarked on a front-end project this basic, there are no build tools involved, just HTML and CSS - it has actually been really refreshing!

This website will serve as a catalog for things I find interesting, thoughts about articles I've read, maybe even the occasional photo.

I'll be back soon with more. - Tim
