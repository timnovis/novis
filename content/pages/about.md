# About

I'm Tim Novis, a web, JavaScript and aspiring ${language} developer from the South of England focussed on building UIs with React & React Native. Outside of programming, my interests mainly lie in music, amateur succulent growing, travel and eating way, way more than I should.

## Currently

[daisie](https://www.daisie.com/) // Nov 2017 â€“ Present

I'm currently working as lead UI engineer and technical director at [daisie](https://www.daisie.com/), a social media startup focussed on creating networking and collaboration tools for the next generation of creatives. Mainly coding in React Native, Node.js and occasionally some Go or Python for smaller services or internal tools.
