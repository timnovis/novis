I've been on holiday in Japan for ~2 weeks. It's the longest break I've taken in quite a while, and I'm having a great time. I've certainly had a chance to reflect on the past two years of my life and career. It's been great to take a step back and think.

I brought my laptop with me "just in case", but I've opened it twice in the time I've been here which has been, quite honestly, liberating. The +9h time difference has been a blessing for my unhealthy Slack addiction, meaning for most of the day, it's completely inactive. Nothing for me to look at!

Some things I've particularly enjoyed:

- Glimmering cleanliness
- Shinkansen (bullet trains)
- Trams in Hiroshima
- Ramen, yakisoba, gyoza
- Asahi vending machines
- Beautiful temples, gardens and shrines
