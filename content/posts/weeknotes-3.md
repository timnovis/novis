It's been a pretty unremarkable week again. I started writing weeknotes in order to remember _more_ about what I'm doing with my life. I should probably start writing them incrementally over the course of a week, rather than getting to the end and being completely blank.

Anyway. This week, from what I remember:

At work I added a bunch of functionality to our internal admin panel. It's a lovely bit of software, a CSR website written with Node & Express, no build step, no fat client side frameworks, and for the most part works without JS at all. Simpler times. I've been thinking a lot about ✨ tools ✨ recently. There's probably a separate blog post coming at some point in the indeterminate future.

On Monday, we had an urgent front-end deployment to roll out, but our CI pipeline was, to put it bluntly, fucked. Much to my amusement, and after much deliberation, we decided to embark on a pretty dodgy exercise of manually copying our static build files to s3. The modern equivalent of drag-and-dropping files on to an FTP server. Full circle?

Spent time with Leah, friends, family at the weekend which was great. This weekend I'm planning on _doing things_ but I'm not entirely sure what yet. Time will tell.
