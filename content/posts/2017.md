### Highlights

* I've worked at two great companies this year, the [latter of which](https://www.daisie.com/) I'm super excited about.
* My programming skills have come by leaps and bounds since this time last year.
* I've been on two breaks to Rome and Sicily, and I'm going to Amsterdam in a few days time.
* I've discovered a load of great new music and podcasts.
* I've rewritten this website to use Hugo for static site generation, hosted on Netlify. I've barely scratched the surface of what Hugo can do, but this website is [open source](https://github.com/timnovis/novis) if you want to see the code.
