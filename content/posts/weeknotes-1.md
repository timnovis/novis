I've been back from Japan for a few days now, the jetlag is finally wearing off after a weekend of feeling horribly confused. Not that I'm complaining.

It's great to see my coworkers and friends again, catching up on all that I've missed over the past 2 weeks. I feel like I'm getting back into the flow.

So far this week at work, I've tied up a few loose ends on the API to do with user locations, fixed a couple of minor outstanding bugs from the backlog and am about to start on a larger piece of work related to notifications & activity, which _sounds_ very vague.

I've started working on a new ✨side project ✨ with my esteemed friend and ex-colleague [Josh](https://joshmcmillan.com/), called [Rhythm](https://rhythm.cool/), to help people write weeknotes and roll them up into some kind of publication.

Until next time.
