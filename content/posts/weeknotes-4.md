A slightly belated and extremely sparse weeknotes, sorry fans. The weather has been absolutely glorious this bank holiday weekend so I've been spending most of my time out and about, seeing friends and family, as well as attending my first Seder on Friday with Leah's family which was great. As far as work goes, it's been extremely regular. I've been working on some fairly cool challenges. I don't have much else to add.
