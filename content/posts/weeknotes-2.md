A day late. It's been an unremarkable week.

At work, I:

- Shipped a large-ish new feature to our API service
- Started working on tools to assist in moderating content on the platform
- Spent a lot of time with [Raf](https://www.instagram.com/raftheshiba/), Utku's new Shiba Inu

Personally, I:

- Am coming down with a cold
- Will probably work from home tomorrow
- Spent time seeing family on the weekend
- Listened to a lot of Kate Bush today
